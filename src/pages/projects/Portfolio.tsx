    'This portfolio website showcases my projects, skills and personality through an interactive and visually engaging interface. Built with React and TypeScript, it features a unique design philosophy that combines playful elements with professional presentation. The site demonstrates advanced frontend techniques while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.',
    'The standout feature is the collection of 30+ draggable star elements scattered throughout the Projects section, each randomly selected from 11 unique hand-drawn designs. Users can interact with these stars on both desktop and mobile devices through mouse and touch events, with smooth animations and visual feedback. The special "drag me!" star in the corner invites user interaction with custom arrow graphics and fonts.',

      The Skills section features a 3D dome gallery from

      that I tailored to my personal vision, displaying technology icons in a rotating carousel with radial gradient edge 
      blending for a seamless visual effect. Every aspect of the design, from the dusty pink color scheme (#EABEC3, #D9A5AC, #FDD5DF) 
      to the custom-drawn project favicons, creates a cohesive and memorable user experience that stands out from typical portfolio websites.
